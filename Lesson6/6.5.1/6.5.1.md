# Advanced Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 6.3.1 - Functions Activity

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
**Functions Activity**

In this activity we will use functions to make sections of our code reusable.

We will take some code which builds a chicken pen and change it to be able to be used in mulitple places in our code.

## Step 2
The below code has been provided which will build a 5 x 5 pen of oak fence with some chickens inside.

Return to the game and run the code and observe what happens. 

Return to Code Builder and continue the tutorial after you have run the code.
```template
player.onChat("build", function () {
    blocks.fill(
    OAK_FENCE,
    pos(2, 0, 2),
    positions.add(
    pos(2, 0, 2),
    pos(4, 0, 4)
    ),
    FillOperation.Replace
    )
    blocks.fill(
    AIR,
    positions.add(
    pos(2, 0, 2),
    pos(1, 0, 1)
    ),
    positions.add(
    pos(2, 0, 2),
    pos(3, 0, 3)
    ),
    FillOperation.Replace
    )
    for (let index = 0; index < Math.randomRange(1, 7); index++) {
        mobs.spawn(CHICKEN, pos(3, 0, 3))
    }
})
```

## Step 3 @unplugged
If we wanted to build multiple pens there are a number of methods we could use to do this:
- We could copy and paste the code and have the same code multiple times
- We could use a loop around this code 
- We could move the code into a function and call the function multple times

The third option is the preferred option as it means there is only one copy of the code and the code can be called from multiple places.

## Step 4 
From the ``||FUNCTIONS: FUNCTIONS||`` drawer place a ``||FUNCTIONS: function doSomething||`` block at the end of the code to define a new function.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
function doSomething() {

}
```
## Step 5
Change the name of the function to buildPen by replacing the text doSomething with buildPen

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
function buildPen() {

}
```
## Step 6
Move all of the code from the player.onChat event handler to the buildPen function.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
function buildPen() {
    blocks.fill(
    OAK_FENCE,
    pos(2, 0, 2),
    positions.add(
    pos(2, 0, 2),
    pos(4, 0, 4)
    ),
    FillOperation.Replace
    )
    blocks.fill(
    AIR,
    positions.add(
    pos(2, 0, 2),
    pos(1, 0, 1)
    ),
    positions.add(
    pos(2, 0, 2),
    pos(3, 0, 3)
    ),
    FillOperation.Replace
    )
    for (let index = 0; index < Math.randomRange(1, 7); index++) {
        mobs.spawn(CHICKEN, pos(3, 0, 3))
    }
}
player.onChat("build", function () {
    
})
```
## Step 7
For the code in the function to run we need to call the function.

To do this enter the name of the function followed by a set of bracket/parenthesis where you want to call it. In our case we want to call the function in the player.onChat event handler.

Once you have added the code return to the game and test your code out by entering the text build into the chat window and a pen with some chickens should be built.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("build", function () {
    buildPen()
})
```
## Step 8
At the moment there is no difference when running the code - it still create a pen containing chickens near the player. 

What if we wanted to create multiple pens?

The pens are built a few blocks away from the players position so lets teleport the player to a new position for each pen.

After the ```javascript buildPen()``` code add a new line and from the ``||PLAYER: PLAYER||`` drawer place a ``||PLAYER: teleport to pos||`` block on the new line.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("build", function () {
    buildPen()
    player.teleport(pos(0,0,0))
})
```

## Step 9
Place these 2 lines of code within a for loop and change the loop to enumerate 3 times
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("build", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 3; index++) {
        buildPen()
        player.teleport(pos(0, 0, 0))
    }
})
```

## Step 10
Change the position the player is teleporting to on each loop enumeration to ~6, ~0, ~0 by changin the coordinates in the ```javascript pos(0, 0, 0)``` code.

This will ensure each pen is 1 block apart.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("build", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 3; index++) {
        buildPen()
        player.teleport(pos(6, 0, 0))
    }
})
```

## Step 11 @unplugged
Lets test our code.
To test your code:
1. Return to your Minecraft world
2. Open the chat window by pressing the t key and enter the command mine. 
3. Enter the command build and press enter 
4. Notice 3 pens with chickens are built
