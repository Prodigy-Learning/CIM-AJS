# Advanced Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 6.2 - JavaScript - Semantic Errors

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
**JavaScript Semantic Errors**

Semantic errors can be very difficult to find and are the result of a logic error in your code.

Semantic errors usually do not stop your program from running but usually result in your program not functioning as you expect to.

This could be for example:
- Looping around a loop one to many times

- Setting the value of a variable incorrectly

- The logic of a boolean condition being mixed up


## Step 2 @unplugged
**Looping around a loop one to many times**

Having a loop run an incorrect number of times is a common semantic error and an easy one to make.

Take for example if we want to have the agent build a wall of blocks in length you might use a for loop as in the below code 

**JavaScript**

## Step 3
The code has been provided below, run the code and observe what happens and return to Code Builder (remember to give your Agent some inventory!).

Return to the tutorial by pressing the C key on your keyboard or tapping the Agent icon on your screen when finished.
```template
player.onChat("buildWall", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 2)
    for (let index = 0; index <= 4; index++) {
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.place(BACK)
    }
})
```

## Step 4 @unplugged
**Looping around a loop one to many times**

If we run this code you will notice that the agent builds a wall of 5 blocks rather than 4.

Can you spot why the wall is 5 blocks long rather than 4?

## Step 5 @unplugged
**Looping around a loop one to many times**

The issue is with the for loop - notice the loop control variable (called index) starts at 0 and we are looping while index is less than or equal to 4.

If we walk through the code the first time the loop runs index is 0, the second time index is 1, third time index is 2, fourth time index is 3 and the fifth time index is 4 - the loop stops enumerating when index is updated to 5 on the sixth iteration of the loop.
Therefore the contents of the loop run 5 times in total - one too many that what we would like.

## Step 6 @unplugged
**Looping around a loop one to many times**

The issue here is that we are looping one too many times.

There are 3 methods we could use to ensure our loop runs only 4 times, not 5 as it does currently.

The first method would be to reduce the ending value of our loop control variable (index).

In this example we have changed the loop control to loop from index =0 while index is less than or equal to 3.

This means the value of index will be - 0, then 1, then 2, then 3 and the loop will stop enumerating after 4 times.

## Step 7 
The code has been provided below, run the code and observe what happens (it should now perform as expected) and return to Code Builder (remember to give your Agent some inventory!)

```template
player.onChat("buildWall", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 2)
    for (let index = 0; index <= 3; index++) {
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.place(BACK)
    }
})
```
## Step 8 @unplugged
**Looping around a loop one to many times**

Another method you could use to fix this error is to increase the starting value of the loop control variable (index).

In this example we have changed index to start at 1 instead of 0 and for the loop to run whilst index <= 4 (as the end condition was originally).

This means the value of index will be - 1, then 2, then 3 and finally 4 then the loop will stop enumerating as the next time index will be 5 which is not less than or equal to 4.

## Step 9 @unplugged
**Looping around a loop one to many times**

The final method you could use to fix this error is to change the comparison operator used in the end condition of the loop (index <= 4).

Rather than specify that index should be less than or equal to 4 if we specify that index is less than 4 when the value of index reaches 4 the loop will no longer enumerate.

This means the value of index will be - 0, then 1, then 2, then 4 and will the loop will stop enumerating when index is updated to 4 as index is not less than 4.

## Step 10 @unplugged
**Setting the value of a variable incorrectly**

In this example we want to lay gold blocks beneath our feet wherever we walk.

**JavaScript**
![alt text](https://advancedjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson6/6.2/images/8.jpg?raw=true "JavaScript")

## Step 11
The code has been provided below, run the code and observe what happens and return to Code Builder.
```template
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
    blocks.place(GOLD_BLOCK, pos(-1,0,0))
})

```
## Step 12 @unplugged
**Setting the value of a variable incorrectly**

When we run the program however a gold block is placed behind us each time we move but it it placed on the ground rather than below our feet.

Can you spot why this?

## Step 13 @unplugged
**Setting the value of a variable incorrectly**

Look carefully at the pos(-1, 0, 0) code - this is a relative position 1 block behind us on the X axis, and the same block on the Y and Z axis.

To fix we change the X part of the coordinate to be 0 and the Y part of the coordinate to be -1 which is the relative position 1 block below us.

If we run the program again, we should see that block are now laid in the ground as we wanted.

## Step 14
The code has been provided below, run the code and observe what happens (it should behave as expected) and return to Code Builder.
```template
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
    blocks.place(GOLD_BLOCK, pos(0,-1,0))
})
```


## Step 15 @unplugged
**The logic of a boolean condition being mixed up**

In this example we have created some code which we want to perform the following action:

When the user enters the mine command the agent should be teleported to the player and mine whilst there are blocks in front of the agent.

**JavaScript**
![alt text](https://advancedjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson6/6.2/images/12.jpg?raw=true "JavaScript")

## Step 16 
The code has been provided below, return to the game and position yourself in front of some of the blocks placed earlier and run the code and observe what happens and return to Code Builder.
```template
player.onChat("mine", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    while(agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD) == false) {
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.collectAll()
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    }
})
```
## Step 17 @unplugged
**The logic of a boolean condition being mixed up**

If you run the code however you should notice that the agent stops when they encounter a block in front of them and will mine whilst there are no blocks (i.e. air blocks) in front of them. This is the opposite of what we want to do.

## Step 18 @unplugged
**The logic of a boolean condition being mixed up**

The issue here is that we have the boolean logic which controls our while statement incorrect.

The  ```while (agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, SixDirection.Forward) == false) { ... } ``` while statement will loop around while the agent does not detect a block in front of it.

To fix change the boolean false value to true so that the logic is that the loop will run as long as the agent does detect a block in front of it.

## Step 19 
The code has been provided below, run the code and observe what happens and return to Code Builder.
```template
player.onChat("mine", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    while(agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD) == true) {
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.collectAll()
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    }
})
```
