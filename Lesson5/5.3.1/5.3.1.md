**Boolean Operators Activity**

In this activity we will use boolean operators to turn our agent into a gold miner!

We will write some code which will cause our agent to continuously mine forward until it reaches gold.

## Step 2
Delete the default code in the code editor.

## Step 3 
From the Player drawer place an onChat("jump", function (num1: number, num2: number, num3: number) { }) block on line 1.

## Step 4 
Change the chat command to respond to the command mine rather than jump by changing the text jump to mine.

## Step 5
From the Agent drawer place a teleportToPlayer() block on line 2 to bring the agent to your location

##Step 6
Add a new line after line 2 and from the Loops drawer place a while (true) { } block on line 3 after the agent.teleportToPlayer().

We will use this while loop to continuously move the agent forward and mine whilst the block in front of the agent is not a gold block or an air block.

##Step 7
From the Agent drawer place a destroy(SixDirection.Forward) block and a move(SixDirection.Forward, 1) block inside the while loop on lines 4 and 5.

##Step 8
At the moment the condition of the while loop is true - this means the loop will continuously run, forever.

We want to change this behaviour so that the loop will only run if the block in front of the agent is not either a gold block or an air block.

##Step 9
To do this we will use the inspect(AgentInspection.Block, SixDirection.Forward) block from the Agent drawer to check the type of block in front of the agent.

Delete the word true from the condition in the while statement on line 3 so we can build up a more complex condition for the while loop.

##Step 10
Add the text () || () in-between the brackets of the while statement to start setting up the complex comparison we will perform in the while loop. This is setting up an or boolean condition between the 2 conditions inside the brackets on either side.

##Step 11
Inside the first set of brackets we will check the block in front of the agent to see if it is a gold block and inside the second set of brackets we will check to see if the block in front of the agent is an air block.

Inside the first set of brackets place an agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, SixDirection.Forward) block.

##Step 12
After the closing bracket for the inspect command put a space and a double =

##Step 13
After the == place a block(Block.Grass) block from the Blocks drawer.

This now results in the first part of the comparison checking the block in front of the agent to see if it is a grass block.

##Step 14
Change the Block.Grass to Block.GoldBlock so that it checks for a gold block in front of the agent.

##Step 15
Next we need to build up the right hand side of the or comparison. This side will check the block in front of the agent to see if it is an air block. We are checking if it is an air block as we do not want the agent to mine forever!

In the set of brackets after the or (||) operator place an agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, SixDirection.Forward) from the Agent drawer.

##Step 16
As we have done previously for the left hand side of the or operator after the closing bracket for the inspect command put a space and a double = symbol

##Step 17
Again as we have done previously place a block(Block.Grass) block from the Blocks drawer and this time change the type of block to an Air block by changing the word Grass to Air

This now results in the first part of the comparison checking the block in front of the agent to see if it is a grass block.

##Step 18
Our code will now run but the logic is not correct.

The code within the while loop will run while the block in front of the agent is a gold block or an air block.

This is not the action we want to happen. What we want to happen is the code within the while loop runs when the block in front of the agent is not a gold or air block.

##Step 19
To do this we first place an opening bracket before the first opening bracket of the while loop and a closing bracket after the last bracket of the while loop (before the opening curly bracket - on lines 3 and 6 in the image)

##Step 20
Finally add a not operator (!) between the first 2 opening brackets of the while loop.

##Step 21
This results in reversing the result of the comparison within the brackets which is:

(agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, SixDirection.Forward) == blocks.block(Block.GoldBlock)) || (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, SixDirection.Forward) == blocks.block(Block.Air))

Therefore if the block in front of the agent is a gold block or an air block this comparison would normally result in true. Performing a not operation on this result will mean the loop will run only if the block is not either of these blocks.

##Step 22 @unplugged
Lets test our code.
To test your code:
1. Return to your Minecraft world and position yourself directly in front of one of the lines of blocks.

2. Open the chat window by pressing the t key and enter the command mine. 
Notice the agent should destroy all blocks until it reaches a gold or air block.
Test your code out but mining all 3 rows of blocks - the agent should stop when they reach an air block or a gold block.
