**Comparison Operators Activity**

In this activity we will use comparison operators to enhance the functionality of if then blocks.

We will create a program which will track the number of a chosen type of block placed and every time we lay 5 blocks we will tell the player the total amount of blocks laid.

In this program we will create a variable to track the number of blocks placed which we will update when we lay or destroy a block of our chosen type. When this variable reaches a value which is divisible by 5 we will tell the player the total number of blocks currently laid.

## Step 2
Delete the default code in the code editor.

## Step 3 
Enter the following text on line 1

let noOfBlocks = 0

This will create a variable named noOfBlocks for us and set it to a starting value of 0.

We will use this variable to keep count of the number of blocks placed.

## Step 4 
From the Blocks drawer place an onBlockPlaced(0, function () {}) block on line 2.

This is an event handler which will run some code in response to placing a certain type of block.

## Step 5
Change the event handler to run when we place a grass block by changing the 0 on line 2 to Block.Grass

##Step 6
From the Variables drawer place an item += 1 block on line 3.

This line of code increases the value of a variable by 1.

Change the variable we want to change by changing the text item to noOfBlock

##Step 7
Position your cursor at the end of line 3 and insert a new line by pressing the enter key on the keyboard.

##Step 8
From the Logic drawer place an if (true) { } block on line 4.

We will use this if statement to check if the number of blocks placed is a multiple of 5 and if so run some code.

##Step 9
The condition we want to evaluate in the if statement is if the number of blocks placed is a multiple of 5. We can do this by checking the remainder when we divide the noOfBlocks variable by 5 and if this remainder is 0 the noOfBlocks variable is a multiple of 5.

Replace the default true condition in the if statement with the following:

noOfBlocks % 5 == 0

The % mathematical operator in JavaScript is the remainder of a division operation.

##Step 10
From the player drawer place a say("Hi!) block on line 5 inside the if statement and change the text to Number of blocks placed:

##Step 11
Position the cursor between the closing quote for "Number of blocks placed: " and the closing bracket of the say function and add the text + noOfBlocks (careful to place this outside the quotes and before the closing bracket).

This allows us to join variables together in JavaScript so the say command will tell us the number of blocks placed.

##Step 11 @unplugged
Lets test our code.
To test your code:
1. Return to your Minecraft world and equip yourself with some grass blocks

2. Place some grass blocks and noticee that after every 5th grass block placed you will be told the number of blocks you have placed.
