# Advanced Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 5.1.1 - JavaScript - IF THEN and IF THEN ELSE in JavaScript Activity

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
**IF THEN and IF THEN ELSE in JavaScript Activity**

In this activity we will create an IF THEN ELSE statement in JavaScript

We will create some code which will detect if we are walking on ice or not.

## Step 2
If there is any code in the code editor delete it and continue to the next step. 

## Step 3 
From the Player drawer drag out a blue player.onTravelled(TravelMethod.Walk, function () { }) ... block and drop it onto the code editor surface
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
    
})
```

## Step 4 
From the Logic drawer place a if (true) { } else { } block on line 2 inside the event handler.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
    if (true) {

    } else {

    }
})
```

## Step 5
Delete the default true condition on line 2 (careful not to delete the brackets!)
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
    if ( ) {

    } else {

    }
})
```

##Step 6
From the blocks drawer place a blocks.testForBlock(GRASS, pos(0,0,0)) block inside the brackets on line 2.

This function will check for a certain type of block at a coordinate position and returns true if the blocks exists at that position or false if the block does not exist at the position.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
    if (blocks.testForBlock(GRASS, pos(0,0,0))) {

    } else {

    }
})
```

##Step 7
Change the first parameter in the testForBlock (0) to be ICE and the second parameter to be pos(0, -1, 0).

The pos(0, -1, 0) creates a relative coordinate which is the block under the players feet.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
    if (blocks.testForBlock(ICE, pos(0,-1,0))) {

    } else {

    }
})
```

##Step 8
From the player drawer place a say(":)") block on line 3 inside the first section of the IF THEN ELSE statement.

This line of code will run when the block below the players feet is ice.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
    if (blocks.testForBlock(ICE, pos(0,-1,0))) {
        player.say(":)")
    } else {

    }
})
```

##Step 9
Change the text in the say function to Careful you do not slip on the ice! (ensure you keep the double quotes!)
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
    if (blocks.testForBlock(ICE, pos(0,-1,0))) {
        player.say("Careful you do not slip on the ice!")
    } else {

    }
})
```

##Step 10
From the player drawer place a say(":)") block on line 5 inside the second section of the IF THEN ELSE statement.

This line of code will run when the block below the players feet is not ice.

Change the text of the say command to Find some ice!
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
    if (blocks.testForBlock(ICE, pos(0,-1,0))) {
        player.say("Careful you do not slip on the ice!")
    } else {
        player.say("Find some ice!")
    }
})

```
##Step 11 @unplugged
Lets test our code.
To test your code:
1. Return to your Minecraft world and walk around the current island.

2. Notice that when you walk on the ice blocks on the island a message saying Careful you do not slip on the ice! appears and at all other times a message Find some ice! appears

## Step 12 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto the next Non Player Character.
