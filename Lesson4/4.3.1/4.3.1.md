# Advanced Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 4.3.1 - JavaScript - For Loops Activity

## Step 1 @unplugged
**For Loops Activity**

In this activity we will create and modify for loops in JavaScript.

We will create some for loops which will farm the area of grassland on this island.

## Step 2
Delete the default code in the code editor.

## Step 3 
From the Player drawer drag out a blue player.onChat... block and drop it onto the code editor surface
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("jump", function () {
    
})
```

## Step 4 
Change the text jump to farm to change the event handler to respond to the command farm.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("farm", function () {
    
})
```

## Step 5
We have 2 rows of 10 grass blocks which we can farm on.

Firstly lets get our agent to walk across the 10 blocks before farming them.

From the loops drawer place a for (let i-0; i < 5; i++){ } block of code on line 2

Notice the default loop control variables name is i and its initial value is 0 and the loop will run while i is less than 5.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("jump", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 5; index++) {
    	
    }   
})
```

## Step 6 
Change the value of end condition for the loop to 2 by changing the 5 to a 2 in the i < 5 part of the for loop.

This will cause the loop to enumerate twice and we will use it to run the same code on the 2 lines of grass blocks.

We will write some code for the agent to move 10 blocks next.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("jump", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
    	
    }   
})
```
## Step 7 
From the loops drawer place a for (let i-0; i < 5; i++){ } block of code on line 3 (inside the existing for loop)
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("jump", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
        for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {

        }    	
    }   
})
```
## Step 8 
Change the value of end condition for the loop to 11 by changing the 5 to a 11 in the i < 5 part of the for loop.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("jump", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
        for(let i = 0; i < 11; i++) {

        }    	
    }   
})
```
## Step 9 
From the Agent drawer place a move(FORWARD, 1) block on line 4 inside the 2 loops.

This will cause the agent to move forward by one every time the loop enumerates.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("jump", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
        for(let i = 0; i < 11; i++) {
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        }    	
    }   
})
```
##Step 10
Once the agent reaches the end of one of the lines of Grass blocks we need him to turn and move onto the adjacent set of grass blocks.

Place the cursor at the end of the code on line 5 (after the }) and press return to create a new line.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("jump", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
        for(let i = 0; i < 11; i++) {
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        } 

    }   
})
```
##Step 11
On this new blank line place a agent.turn(TurnDirection.Left) block from the Agent drawer.

This will move our agent forward one block and turn him 90 degrees. We want to turn him 180 degrees so he can move back down the line of blocks so add another move(SixDirection.Forward, 1) and turn(TurnDirection.Left) block after the existing
one.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("jump", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
        for(let i = 0; i < 11; i++) {
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        } 
        agent.turn(TurnDirection.Left)    
        agent.turn(TurnDirection.Left)   	
    }   
})
```
##Step 12
Before we test out code lets make the agent teleport to our position as the first action in the program.

To do this place your cursor at the end of line 1 (after the {) and press return to add a new blank line.

From the Agent drawer place a teleportToPlayer block on this new empty line (line 2)
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("jump", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
        for(let i = 0; i < 11; i++) {
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        } 
        agent.turn(TurnDirection.Left)    
        agent.turn(TurnDirection.Left)   	
    }   
})
```
##Step 13 @unplugged
Lets test our code.
To test your code:
1. Return to your Minecraft world and position yourself on top of the red wool block and run the command farm in the chat window.
![alt text](https://advancedjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson4/4.3.1/images/1.jpg?raw=true "Test")
2. Your agent should appear, take 11 steps forward until the block after the end of the grass (as our inner loop starts at 0 and runs until i is less than 11 so 11 times in total). The agent should then turn 90 degrees, move one block forward, turn 90 degrees again and repeat the process to return to the red block.
