**For Loops Extension Activity**

We will make changes to our program so the Agent not only walks but farms the land also.

## Step 2
Place the cursor at the end of line 4 (the 2nd for loop) and press the return key to add a new line.

## Step 3 
To farm we need to till the ground and then place seeds.

From the Agent drawer place a till(SixDirection.Forward) block on line 5 and place a new line after it.

On the new line place a place(SixDirection.Back) block on line 6 after the till line.

## Step 4 
Change the direction in the place block to forward by changing the SixDirection.Back to SixDirection.Forward

##Step 5 @unplugged
Lets test our code.
To test your code:
1. Before we begin we need to get some seeds into our inventory and place them in the Agents slot 1.

2. Move to the Red wool block again and run the farm command

3. Your agent should till the land and place seeds on all the grass blocks. Now you will get an error when the agent tries to place seeds on the wool blocks - ignore these at the minute as we will look at how we
could fix this later.
