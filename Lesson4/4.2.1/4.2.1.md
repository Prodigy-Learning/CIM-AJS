# Advanced Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 4.2.1 - JavaScript - While Loops Activity

## Step 1 @unplugged
**While Loops Activity**

In this activity we will create and modify while loops in JavaScript.

We will create a program which will tell us if we are walking on grass until we walk on another type of block.

## Step 2
Delete the default code in the code editor.

## Step 3 
From the Player drawer drag out a blue player.onTravelled... block and drop it onto the code editor surface

This block by default will run when the player walks.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
	
})
```

## Step 4 
From the loops drawer place a while (true) { } block on line 2.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
	while (true) {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 5
From the Player drawer place a say(":)") block on line 3
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
	while (true) {
        player.say(":)")	
    }
})
```

## Step 6 
Change the text :) to You're walking on grass! to change the text that will be displayed as a chat message.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
	while (true) {
        player.say("You're walking on grass!")	
    }
})
```

## Step 7 
At the moment if you run the program the while loop will run continuously as its boolean condition is always true. We want to change this. We will change it so that the code inside the while loop will only run when we are on top of a grass block.

To do this delete the word true on line 2 bring a testForBlock (0, null) block out and place it in between the brackets where the word true was.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
	while (while (blocks.testForBlock(GRASS, pos(0,0,0)))) {
        player.say("You're walking on grass!")	
    }
})
```
## Step 8 
The blocks.testForBlock method takes 2 parameters - the first one being the type of block to check for and the second one being the coordinate position to check.

Ensure the block that is being checked for is a GRASS block to test for grass blocks.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
	while (while (blocks.testForBlock(GRASS, pos(0,0,0)))) {
        player.say("You're walking on grass!")	
    }
})
```
## Step 9 
Change the second parameter pos(0,0,0) to pos(0, -1, 0) to check the relative coordinate of ~0 ~-1 ~0 which is the block below our players feet
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
	while (while (blocks.testForBlock(GRASS, pos(0,-1,0)))) {
        player.say("You're walking on grass!")	
    }
})
```

## Step 10 @unplugged
Lets test our code.
To test your code:
1. Return to your Minecraft world and walk around the island ensuring you walk over the grass blocks on the island.

2. You should see a chat message constantly appear when you are on top of a grass block (and stop when you move off a grass block)

## Step 11 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto the next Non Player Character
