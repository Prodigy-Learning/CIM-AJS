# Advanced Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 4.4 - JavaScript - Loops Assessment Challenge

## Step 1 @unplugged
**Loops Assessment Challenge**

Can you change the code below to create the 4 walls of a house in response to the build chat command - the walls are to be 6 blocks wide by 5 blocks high.

Note there are 4 changes you need to make.

Note: you do not need to create the program in MakeCode but you can if you wish to test.

Click next to modify the code.

**JavaScript**
```javascript 
player.onChat("build", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    for (let x = 1; x <= 4; x++){
        agent.move(UP, 1)
        for (let y = 0; y <= 3; y++){
            for(let z = 0; z <= 8; z++){
                agent.move(FORWARD, 2)
                agent.place(UP)
            }
            agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        }
    }  
})
```

    for (let x = 1; x <= 4; x++){
        agent.move(UP, 1)
        for (let y = 0; y <= 3; y++){
            for(let z = 0; z <= 8; z++){
                agent.move(FORWARD, 2)
                agent.place(UP)
