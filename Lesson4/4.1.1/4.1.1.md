## Step 1 @unplugged
**Repeat Loops Activity**

In this activity we will create and modify for loops in JavaScript.

We will create a loop which will create a set of stairs for us.

## Step 2
If there is any code in the code editor delete it and continue to the next step. 

## Step 3 
From the ``||PLAYER: PLAYER ||`` drawer drag out a ``||PLAYER: run code on chat command jump||``. block and drop it onto the code editor surface at line 1.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("jump", function () {
    
})
```
## Step 4 
Change the text jump to stairs to change the event handler to respond to the command stairs.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("stairs", function () {
    
})
```

## Step 5
From the ``||LOOPS: LOOPS ||`` drawer place a ``||LOOPS: for ||``  block of code on line 2 to add the below for loop 

```javascript 
for (let i=0; i < 5; i++){ } 
```

Notice the default loop control variables name is i and its initial value is 0 and the loop will run while i is less than 5.

How many times will the loop therefore run?
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("stairs", function () {
    for (let i=0; i < 5; i++){ 
    
    } 
})
```
## Step 6 @unplugged
How many times will the loop therefore run?

Answer: 5 times - when the value of i is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

When the value of i reaches 5 the loop will no longer run.

## Step 7 
Change the value of end condition for the loop to 10 by changing the 5 to a 10 in the i < 5 part of the for loop.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("stairs", function () {
    for (let i=0; i < 10; i++){ 
    
    } 
})
```

## Step 8 
From the ``||BLOCKS: BLOCKS ||`` drawer place a ``||BLOCKS: fill with block from to to operator ||`` block inside the loop at line 3 to generate the below code:
```javascript 
blocks.fill(GRASS, pos(0, 0, 0), pos(0, 0, 0))
```

This fill function of the block takes 3 parameters - the block to use to fill and the start and end coordinates to fill between.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("stairs", function () {
    for (let i=0; i < 5; i++){ 
        blocks.fill(GRASS, pos(0, 0, 0), pos(0, 0, 0))
    } 
})
```

## Step 9 
By default it will use Grass blocks to fill.

Replace the word GRASS with the word COBBLESTONE to use Cobblestone blocks instead.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("stairs", function () {
    for (let i=0; i < 5; i++){ 
        blocks.fill(COBBLESTONE, pos(0, 0, 0), pos(0, 0, 0))
    } 
})
```
## Step 10 
The final 2 parameters are coordinates.
```javascript
pos(0, 0, 0)
```
creates a coordinate position relative to the player.

The first pos(0,0,0) represents the start point of where you want to fill.

Change this to set a relative position which is 2 blocks to your right (when first run as i is 0) and is where the staircase will start. 
To do this change the first 0 (the X coordinate) to i+2.
```javascript
pos(i+2, 0, 0)
```

We use the value of i+2 so that every time the loop enumerates the position we are laying blocks at will be increased by 1.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("stairs", function () {
    for (let i=0; i < 5; i++){ 
        blocks.fill(COBBLESTONE, pos(i+2, 0, 0), pos(0, 0, 0))
    } 
})
```
## Step 11
The second pos(0,0,0) represents the end point of where you want to fill

Change this to be i+2 on the X axis and i on the Y axis as below 
```javascript
pos(i+2, i, 0)
```
This sets a relative position 2 blocks + i to your right and i blocks up on the Y axis.

This should mean that the first time the loop is run the value of i is 0 therefore the 1st coordinates will be ~2 ~0 ~0 and ~2 ~0 ~0 and one block will be placed 2 blocks to your right.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("stairs", function () {
    for (let i=0; i < 5; i++){ 
        blocks.fill(COBBLESTONE, pos(i+2, 0, 0), pos(i+2, i, 0))
    } 
})
```
## Step 12
The second time the loop runs the coordinates will be ~3 ~0 ~0 and ~3 ~1 ~0 and two blocks will be placed 3 blocks to your right.

The loop will continue to run another 8 times whilst i has a value of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 and result in a set of steps being built

##Step 13 @unplugged
Lets test our code.
To test your code:
1. Return to your Minecraft world, move to the center of the island and run the command stairs in the chat window.

2. A set of stairs should be built 2 blocks to your right - remember that depending on the way you are facing the x axis may not be your right hand side!

## Step 14 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto the next Non Player Character
