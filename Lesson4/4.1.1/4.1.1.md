## Step 1 @unplugged
**Repeat Loops Activity**

In this activity we will create and modify for loops in JavaScript.

We will create a loop which will create a set of stairs for us.

## Step 2
Delete the default code in the code editor.

## Step 3 
From the Player drawer drag out a blue player.onChat... block and drop it onto the code editor surface
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("jump", function () {
    
})
```
## Step 4 
Change the text jump to stairs to change the event handler to respond to the command stairs.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("stairs", function () {
    
})
```

## Step 5
From the loops drawer place a 
```javascript for (let i-0; i < 5; i++){ } 
```
block of code on line 2

Notice the default loop control variables name is i and its initial value is 0 and the loop will run while i is less than 5.

How many times will the loop therefore run?
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("stairs", function () {
    for (let i-0; i < 5; i++){ 
    
    } 
})
```
## Step 6 @unplugged
How many times will the loop therefore run?

Answer: 5 times - when the value of i is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

## Step 7 
Change the value of end condition for the loop to 10 by changing the 5 to a 10 in the i < 5 part of the for loop.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("stairs", function () {
    for (let i-0; i < 10; i++){ 
    
    } 
})
```

## Step 8 
From the Blocks drawer place a 
```javascript blocks.fill(0, null, null) 
```
block inside the loop at line 3

This fill function of the block takes 3 parameters - the block to use to fill and the start and end coordinates to fill between.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("stairs", function () {
    for (let i-0; i < 5; i++){ 
        blocks.fill(0, null, null)
    } 
})
```

## Step 9 
Replace the 0 with the words Block.Grass (be careful you get the case correct and do not forget the full stop between the 2 words!).

This tells the fill method to grass blocks to fill with.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("stairs", function () {
    for (let i-0; i < 5; i++){ 
        blocks.fill(Block.Grass, null, null)
    } 
})
```
## Step 10 
The final 2 parameters are coordinates.

Replace the first null with the text 
```javascript
positions.create(i+2, 0, 0)
```
This sets a relative position which is 2 blocks to your right (when first run as i is 0) and is where the staircase will start. We use the value of i+2 so that every time the loop enumerates the position we are laying blocks at will be increased by 1.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("stairs", function () {
    for (let i-0; i < 5; i++){ 
        blocks.fill(Block.Grass, positions.create(i+2, 0, 0), null)
    } 
})
```
## Step 11
Replace the 2nd null with the text 
```javascript
positions.create(i+2, i, 0)
```
This again sets a relative position 2 blocks + i to your right and i blocks up on the Y axis.

This should mean that the first time the loop is run the value of i is 0 therefore the 1st coordinates will be ~2 ~0 ~0 and ~2 ~0 ~0 and one block will be laid 2 blocks to your right.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("stairs", function () {
    for (let i-0; i < 5; i++){ 
        blocks.fill(Block.Grass, positions.create(i+2, 0, 0), positions.create(i+2, i, 0))
    } 
})
```
## Step 12
The second time the loop runs the coordinates will be ~3 ~0 ~0 and  ~3 ~1 ~0 and two blocks will be laid 3 blocks to your right.

The loop will continue to run another 8 times whilst i has a value of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 and result in a set of steps being built

##Step 13 @unplugged
Lets test our code.
To test your code:
1. Return to your Minecraft world and run the command stairs in the chat window.

2. A set of stairs should be built 2 blocks to your right - remember that depending on the way you are facing the x axis may not be your right hand side!

## Step 14 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto the next Non Player Character
