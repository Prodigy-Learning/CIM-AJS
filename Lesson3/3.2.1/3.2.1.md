## Step 1 @unplugged
**Changing the value of parameters in JavaScript - Activity**

We have already started to see how JavaScript code compares to block-based coding.

We will now continue to look at JavaScript and start modifying our JavaScript code to change its functionality.

**Read through the whole tutorial and then try to perform the actions**

## Step 2 @unplugged
Previously we have looked at how JavaScript code compares to block-based coding but we haven't changed any of the JavaScript. We will now start to make changes to JavaScript to and see how this affects our Minecraft world.

## Step 3 @unplugged
Lets create a sample program with some simple blocks as detailed in the picture to learn more.

## Step 4 @unplugged
Change to the JavaScript view and compare the block view to the JavaScript.

Notice that the 5 lines of code inside the event handler all call on functions of the player or agent and 4 of these take parameters (the only one not taking a parameter being the agent.teleportToPlayer()).

## Step 5 @unplugged
Return to Minecraft and run the sayHello command in the chat window and notice that a message saying hi appears, your agent appears and turns right and moves one block forward and you then teleport to 10 blocks above your current position.

## Step 6 @unplugged
Go back to the MakeCode window and change the parameter being passed to the player.say function to "Hello player!" (note: keep the double quotes as this is a string variable).

Return to the Minecraft world and open the chat window and issue the sayHello command.

Notice that a chat message reflecting the change you made in JavaScript is now displayed (Hello Player!).

## Step 7 @unplugged
Switch back to the block-based view by clicking on the Convert code to Blocks button. 

Add a say "hi" block from the Player drawer into the event handler.

## Step 8 @unplugged
Return to the MakeCode window and on line 4 delete the word Right from the agent.turn(TurnDirection.Right).

Delete the full stop and press the full stop key on the keyboard.

Notice the drop down that appears listing the 2 values Left and Right. These are the 2 different TurnDirections the agent can turn.

This is known as an enumeration - an enumeration is a set of known values - in this case Left or Right, the direction to turn.

## Step 9 @unplugged
Click on the Left option to autocomplete the text.

Ensure your code appears as in the picture.

Return to your Minecraft world and run the sayHello command again and notice this time your agent will turn left rather than right.

## Step 10 @unplugged
Go back to the MakeCode window and look at line 5

**agent.move(SixDirection.Forward, 1)**

This line of JavaScript is the code which will move the agent in a certain direction by a number of blocks. The move method takes 2 parameters - the first one being the direction to move and the second one the number of blocks to move.

## Step 11 @unplugged
Firstly lets look at the first parameter the - SixDirection.Forward.

As before this is an enumeration of the 6 directions the agent can move in - Forward, Back, Down, Left, Right, Up.

Delete the word Forward and the full stop and add the full stop back in again (careful not to delete the comma!) and notice the 6 values of SixDirection.

## Step 12 @unplugged
Change the direction to Right by setting the first parameter to SixDirection.Right.

The second parameter (the one after the comma) is how many blocks to move and is a number type.

Change this number to 5 to move the agent 5 blocks to the right.

## Step 13 @unplugged
Return to your Minecraft world and check that the agent now moves 5 blocks to the right by running the sayHello command

## Step 14 @unplugged
The final line of code teleports the player to a position defined by a set of relative coordinates.

The teleport function of the player takes a position variable to tell it where to teleport the player to.

This coordinate is created using the positions.create function which takes 3 parameters - the X, Y and Z coordinates.

![alt text](https://advancedjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3.2.1/images/12.jpg?raw=true "Code builder")

## Step 15 @unplugged
Change the coordinates to be ~1 ~20 ~-1 by changing the 3 number parameters in the positions.create to 1, 20, -1 as shown in the picture.

## Step 16 @unplugged
Return to Minecraft and run the sayHello command again.

Notice this time that you are teleported to a position 1 block to your left, 1 block backwards and 20 blocks above your position (depending on what way you are looking!)

## Step 17 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto the next Non Player Character
