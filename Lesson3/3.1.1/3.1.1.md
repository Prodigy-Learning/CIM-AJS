**Comparing blocks to text - Activity**

In this activity we will expore the JavaScript interface in Code Builder and compare various MakeCode blocks to JavaScript code.

**Read through the whole tutorial and then try to perform the actions**

## Step 2 @unplugged
In the Minecraft world open Code Builder by pressing the C key on the keyboard or tapping the Agent icon on screen.

## Step 3 @unplugged
Click on the New Project icon to create a new MakeCode project - the default block-based coding editor with the default on chat command "run" block.

## Step 4 @unplugged
Change the event handler to respond to the command sayHello by changing the text run to sayHello

## Step 5 @unplugged
Click on the Convert code to JavaScript button to display the code in JavaScript.

Notice there are 2 lines of code with an empty line between.

The first line of code starts with player.onChat - this is specifying that we want some code to run when a chat command is issued.

Remember the blue on chat command came from the player drawer - notice that its also coloured blue in JavaScript.

Inside the brackets is where we can specify the chat command we want to respond to and the actions we want to perform when that chat command is used. These are known as parameters.

The first parameter "sayHello" is the chat command we want to respond to.

The second command is code we want to run when that command is issued and will contain a list of other commands when we build up what we want to happen when sayHello is issued.

## Step 7 @unplugged
Switch back to the block-based view by clicking on the Convert code to Blocks button. 

Add a say "hi" block from the Player drawer into the event handler.

## Step 8 @unplugged
Change back to the JavaScript view.

Notice that a single line of code has been added at line 2 - this is the equivalent of the say "Hi" block.

Again as this block came from the player drawer the code starts with the word player.

We want to make the player perform an action (say a word) so we call a function of the player called say.

The say function takes a parameter (what to say) - this is the portion inside the brackets and as what we want to say is text it is enclosed in double quotes (" ").

## Step 9 @unplugged
Switch back to the block-based view by clicking on the Convert code to Blocks button.

Add a teleport to ~0 ~0 ~0 block from the Player drawer into the event handler and change the Y coordinate to 10

## Step 10 @unplugged
Change back to the JavaScript view.

Notice that a single line of code has been added at line 3 - this is the equivalent of the teleport block.

Again the teleport block came from the player drawer so the code starts with the word player and we want the player to be teleported therefore the teleport function is called.

This function takes a parameter - where to be teleported to. This parameter is a coordinate.
